## Overview

The Application API provides operations to manage applications and/or assignments to users or groups for your organization.

**This API is currently in `Beta` status and documentation is *draft* quality.  There may be small inconsistencies with actual API.**

*Note: This API currently only supports applications without user-management features enabled at this time*

### Application Attributes
All applications have the following attributes:

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Unique | Readonly
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
id | unique key for app | String | | | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE
name |  unique key for app definition ([App Names & Settings](#app-names--settings))| String | 1 | 255 | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE
label | unique user-defined display name for app | String | 1 | 50 | FALSE | TRUE | FALSE
created | timestamp when app was created | Date | | | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE
lastUpdated | timestamp when app was last updated | Date | | | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE
status | status of app | Enum: `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE` | | | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE
features | enabled app features | [Features](#features) | | | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
signOnMode | authentication mode of app | [SignOn Mode](#signon-modes) | | | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE
accessibility | access settings for app | [Accessibility Object](#accessibility-object) | | | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
visibility | visibility settings for app | [Visibility Object](#visibility-object) | | | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
credentials | credentials for the specified `signOnMode` | [Application Credentials Object](#application-credentials-object) | | | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
settings | settings for app ([App Names & Settings](#app-names--settings))| | | | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE
_links | discoverable resources related to the app | [JSON HAL](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06) | | | TRUE | FALSE | TRUE

> `id`, `created`, `lastUpdated`, `status`, and `_links` are only available after an app is created


#### App Names & Settings

The Okta Application Network (OAN) defines the catalog of applications that can be added to your Okta organization.  Each application has a unique name (key) and schema that defines the required and optional settings for the application.  When adding an application, the unique app name must be specified in the request as well as any required settings.

The catalog is currently not exposed via an API endpoint.  While additional apps may be added via the API, this endpoint only documents the following template applications:

Name | Example
--- | ---
bookmark | [Add Bookmark Application](#add-bookmark-application)
template_basic_auth | [Add Basic Authentication Application](#add-basic-authentication-application)
template_swa | [Add Plugin SWA Application](#add-plugin-swa-application)
template_swa3field | [Add Plugin SWA (3 Field) Application](#add-plugin-swa-3-field-application)
tempalte_sps | [Add SWA Application (No Plugin)](#add-swa-application-no-plugin)
template_saml_2_0 | [Add SAML 2.0 Application](#add-saml-20-application)
template_wsfed | [Add WS-Federation Application](#add-ws-federation-application)

The current workaround is to manually configure the desired application via the Administration UI in a preview (sandbox) organization and view the application via [Get Application](#get-application)

> As previously stated, this endpoint currently doesn't support creating or managing apps with user management features


#### Features

Applications may support optional features. Most apps only support sign-on and do not allow additional features.  *Note:  At this time additional features may not be configured via the API*

The list of possible features an app may support are:

* PUSH_NEW_USERS
* PUSH_USER_DEACTIVATION
* PROFILE_MASTERING
* REACTIVATE_USERS
* PUSH_PROFILE_UPDATES
* GROUP_PUSH
* IMPORT_NEW_USERS
* PUSH_PASSWORD_UPDATES

This setting modifies the same settings as the `User Management` tab when editing an application in your Okta Administration app.


#### SignOn Modes

Applications support a limited set of sign-on modes that specify how a user is authenticated to the app.

The list of possible modes an app may support are:

Mode | Description
--- | ---
BOOKMARK | Just a bookmark (no-authentication)
BASIC_AUTH | HTTP Basic Authentication with Okta Browser Plugin
BROWSER_PLUGIN | Secure Web Authentication (SWA) with Okta Browser Plugin
SECURE_PASSWORD_STORE | Secure Web Authentication (SWA) with POST (plugin not required)
SAML_2_0 | Federated Authentication with SAML 2.0 WebSSO
WS_FEDERATION | Federated Authentication with WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile

This setting modifies the same settings as the `Sign On` tab when editing an application in your Okta Administration app.


### Accessibility Object

Specifies access settings for the application.

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable  | Default
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
selfService | Enable self service application assignment | Boolean | | | TRUE | FALSE
errorRedirectUrl | Custom error page for this application | String | | | TRUE | NULL (Global Error Page)

~~~ json
{
    "accessibility": {
        "selfService": false,
        "errorRedirectUrl": null
    }
}
~~~


### Visibility Object

Specifies visibility settings for the application.

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Default
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

~~~ json
{
    "visibility": {
        "autoSubmitToolbar": false,
        "hide": {
            "iOS": false,
            "web": false
        },
        "appLinks": {
            "login": true
        }
    }
}
~~~

#### Hide Object

Attribute | Description | DataType | Nullable | Default
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
iOS | Okta Mobile for iOS | Boolean | FALSE | FALSE
web | Okta Web Browser Home Page | Boolean | FALSE | FALSE

#### AppLinks Object

Each application defines 1 or more appLinks that can be published. AppLinks can be disabled by setting the link value to `false` .

### Application Credentials Object

Specifies app credentials and vaulting for the application.

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Default
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
scheme | Determines how credentials are managed for the `signOnMode`  | [Authentication Scheme](#authentication-schemes) | | TRUE | NULL
userNameTemplate | Default username that is generated when an application is assigned to a user | [UserName Template Object](#username-template-object) | | TRUE | *Okta UserName*
userName | Shared username for app | String | 1 | 100 | TRUE | NULL
password | Shared password for app | [Password Object](#password-object) | | | TRUE | NULL

~~~ json
{
    "credentials": {
        "scheme": "SHARED_USERNAME_AND_PASSWORD",
        "userNameTemplate": {
            "template": "${source.login}",
            "type": "BUILT_IN"
        },
        "userName": "test",
        "password": {}
    }
}
~~~

#### Authentication Schemes

Apps that are configured with the `BASIC_AUTH` , `BROWSER_PLUGIN` , or `SECURE_PASSWORD_STORE`  have credentials vaulted by Okta and can be configured with the following schemes:

Scheme | Description | Shared UserName | Shared Password | App UserName | App Password
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
SHARED_USERNAME_AND_PASSWORD | Users share a single username and password set by administrator | Admin:R/W | Admin:W | | |
EXTERNAL_PASSWORD_SYNC  | Administrator sets username, password is the same as user's Okta password | | | Admin:R/W | *Current User Password*
EDIT_USERNAME_AND_PASSWORD  | User sets username and password | | | Admin/User:R/W | Admin/User:W
EDIT_PASSWORD_ONLY  | Administrator sets username, user sets password | | | Admin:R/W | Admin/User:W

> `BOOKMARK`, `SAML_2_0`, and `WS_FEDERATION` signOnModes do not support an authentication scheme as they use a federated SSO protocol.  The `scheme` property should be omitted for apps with these signOnModes

#### UserName Template Object

Specifies the template used to generate a user's username when the application is assigned via a group or directly to a user

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Default
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
template | mapping expression for username | String | | 1024 | TRUE | `${source.login}`
type | type of mapping expression | Enum: `NONE`,  `BUILT_IN`, or `CUSTOM` | | | FALSE | BUILT_IN
userSuffix | suffix for built-in mapping expressions | String | | | TRUE | NULL

> You must use the `CUSTOM` type when defining your own expression that is not built-in

~~~ json
{
    "userNameTemplate": {
        "template": "${source.login}",
        "type": "BUILT_IN"
    }
}
~~~

##### Built-In Expressions

The following expressions are built-in and may be used with the `BUILT_IN` template type:

Name | Template Expression
--- | ---
Okta username | ${source.login}
Okta username prefix | ${fn:substringBefore(source.login, ""@"")}
Email | ${source.email}
Email prefix | ${fn:substringBefore(source.email, ""@"")}

AD SAM Account Name | ${source.samAccountName}
AD SAM Account Name (lowercase) | ${fn:toLowerCase(source.samAccountName)}
AD User Principal Name | ${source.userName}
AD User Principal Name prefix | ${fn:substringBefore(source.userName, ""@"")}
AD Employee ID | ${source.employeeID}
LDAP UID + custom suffix | ${source.userName}${instance.userSuffix}

### Password Object

Specifies a password for a user.  A password value is a **write-only** property.  When a user has a valid password and a response object contains a password credential, then the Password Object will be a bare object without the `value`  property defined (e.g. `password: {}` ) to indicate that a password value exists.

Attribute | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Unique | Validation
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
value | String | | | TRUE | FALSE |

### Application Links Object

Specifies link relations (See [Web Linking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988)) available for the current status of an application using the [JSON Hypertext Application Language](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06) specification.  This object is used for dynamic discovery of related resources and lifecycle operations.  The Links Object is **read-only**.

Relation Name | Description
--- | ---
self | The actual application
activate | [Lifecycle action](#activate-application) to transition application to **ACTIVE** status
deactivate | [Lifecycle action](#deactivate-application) to transition application to **INACTIVE** status
metadata | Protocol-specific metadata document for the configured `SignOnMode`
users |  [User](#application-user-operations) assignments for application
users | [Group](#application-group-operations) assignments for application

## Application User Model

The application user model defines a user's application assignment and credentials.

### Example

~~~ json
{
    "id": "00ubgfEUVRPSHGWHAZRI",
    "scope": "USER",
    "credentials": {
        "userName": "user@example.com",
        "password": { "value": "app_password" }
    },
    "lastUpdated": "2013-09-11T15:56:58.000Z",
    "_links": {
      "user": {
          "href": "https://example.okta.com/api/v1/users/00ubgfEUVRPSHGWHAZRI"
        }
    }
}
~~~

### Application User Attributes

All application users have the following attributes:

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Unique | Readonly
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
id | unique key of user | String | | | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE
scope | toggles the assignment between user or group scope | Enum: `USER` or `GROUP` | | | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE

_links | discoverable resources related to the app user | [JSON HAL](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-05) | | | TRUE | FALSE | TRUE

### Application User Credentials Object

Specifies a user's credentials for the application.  The [Authentication Scheme](#authentication-schemes) of the app determines whether a userName or password can be assigned to a user.

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Default
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
userName | username for app | String | 1 | 100 | TRUE | NULL
password | password for app | [Password Object](#password-object) | | | TRUE | NULL

~~~ json
{
    "credentials": {
        "userName": "test",
        "password": {}
    }
}
~~~

*Note: The [UserName Template Object](#username-template-object) defines the default username generated when a user is assigned to an application.*

If you attempt to assign a username or password to an application with an incompatible [Authentication Scheme](#authentication-schemes) you will receive the following error:

~~~ json
{
    "errorCode": "E0000041",
    "errorSummary": "Credentials should not be set on this resource based on the scheme.",
    "errorLink": "E0000041",
    "errorId": "oaeUM77NBynQQu4C_qT5ngjGQ",
    "errorCauses": [
        {
            "errorSummary": "User level credentials should not be provided for this scheme."
        }
    ]
}
~~~

## Application Group Model

    "_links": {
      "user": {
          "href": "https://example.okta.com/api/v1/users/00ubgfEUVRPSHGWHAZRI"
        }
    }
}
~~~

### Application Group Attributes

All application groups have the following attributes:

Attribute | Description | DataType | MinLength | MaxLength | Nullable | Unique | Readonly
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
id | unique key of group | String | | | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE
lastUpdated | timestamp when app group was last updated | Date | | | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE
